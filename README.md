# VAMPER-F
VAMPER-v2 is a new implementation of the initial VAMPER Ground Temperature Model, in FORTRAN. It has been expanded to include carbon in the soil.

## Dependencies
The implementation is dependent on a NetCDF library to be installed with a Fortran compiler, with the Fortran bindings for NetCDF.

## Test case
Currently implemented with a test case from the Boike dataset (ref. to add and check).
